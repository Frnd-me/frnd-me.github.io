I am currently pursuing my PhD with the [Distributed and Parallel Systems Group](https://dps.uibk.ac.at/) at the University of Innsbruck, where my research focuses on Cloud-Edge-IoT computing. I concentrate on _programming models_, _runtime systems_, _resource management_, and _scheduling_.

Before starting my PhD, I spent over a decade as a software engineer working across various industries, with a focus on computer graphics and digital signal processing. A significant part of my career was in the broadcasting industry, where I contributed to high-profile international TV productions. Additionally, Iâ€™ve worked on a range of other projects, including games, audio effects, and scientific software. Although my involvement in independent software engineering has lessened, I still take on select projects when the opportunity aligns with my interests.

I have been programming since childhood and have experience with many programming languages. My preferred tools include C++, CUDA, C#, and Java, as well as frameworks like OpenGL, Vulkan, and OpenCV.
